# Puff Quilt Design Project
## Introduction
This project combines the art of quilting with the precision of programming to create a unique puff quilt with a random yet uniform distribution of squares. Utilizing R, we generate a sequence to ensure each square finds its place in a harmoniously chaotic order, making every quilt truly one-of-a-kind.

## Materials Needed
- *Fabric*: Two types for each puff (for the top and bottom layers).
- *Batting*: To fill the puffs.
- *Sewing Machine*
- *Thread*: Complementary or contrasting, as preferred.
- *Ruler, Scissors, and Marking Tools*
- *R*: For running the script that determines the layout of the squares.

## Quilt Construction
### Preparing the Squares
1. *Cut the Fabric*: Prepare two sizes of squares for each puff - a smaller square (10x10 cm) for the top layer and a larger square (13x13 cm) for the bottom layer.
2. *Folding*: Align one corner of the smaller square with the larger one. Make a simple fold in the center of one side. Repeat this for all four sides, but on the fourth fold, do not match the corners precisely. Leave a small opening for inserting the batting later.
3. *Inserting Batting*: After folding all sides and before sewing the opening, insert the batting through the small opening left in the previous step.
4. *Closing*: Sew the opening closed with a very small seam allowance. Aim to set your needle position to 0.5 to keep the seam as inconspicuous as possible.

### Sewing the Puffs Together
1. *Columns*: Arrange the puffs in columns as per the random sequence generated by the R script. Sew the puffs together lengthwise, forming columns. Use a large seam allowance by setting the needle position to -2.0, ensuring you sew outside the previous seam allowance.
2. *Rows*: Once all columns are complete, sew them together using the same needle setting (-2.0) to maintain consistency in the seam allowance.

### Using the R Script
The included R script generates a uniformly random sequence for arranging the squares. To use it:

1. Ensure R is installed on your computer. You need the `tidyverse` and `ggpattern` packages.
2. Run the script, adjusting parameters as needed to fit the size of your quilt.
3. Follow the generated sequence when laying out your squares before sewing.
